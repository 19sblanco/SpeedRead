# SpeedRead
A Christmas present for my Dad 2021. My father is a slow reader so I created this application to help him read faster.

### Description
This is a command-line program that is designed to help people read faster.

Provided in this project are the Book of Mormon and the Bible (old and new testament)

However, this program could be extendable to take in any text file as input. 

This program also has configurable settings allowing anyone to start reading at a comfortable speed and work their way up to a faster reading level. 

## How to use

### The Menus
As you start up SpeedRead you will be prompted with a menu asking you whether you would like to begin reading or change the settings. If you choose the option that you would like to begin reading, you can choose to pick up from where you left off from a previous reading or you can begin a reading somewhere new. If you choose to read from somewhere new SpeedRead will ask you which collection would you like to read from (e.g. The Book of Mormon), after choosing a collection you will then be prompted about which book you would like to read from (ex: Third Book of Nephi) then the application will start you at the beginning of that book and you can start reading. 

### Reading
When you start reading SpeedRead will display lines from the chosen book at a certain rate specified by the user depending on their current reading speed level. While reading the user can change the reading speed using keyboard inputs to either increase or decrease the speed at which the text is displayed on the screen. When you exit the app it will remember where you left off and the speed at which you were reading so when you return to the app you can easily pick up where you left off.

### Settings
* Speed: The speed at which the lines of text will display on the screen
* Page size: The maximum number of lines that will be displayed at any given moment
